# ABOUT THE PROJECT

#What it does

Time is money, and it is best invested doing things you are great at. This is especially true when you are in an organization working towards a progressive goal. It is easy to hire a multitude of skilled people and develop a task force to handle your daily support and manage operation, but, for non profit organizations that run on the gathered support of common masses it is a critical task to gather such a task force outright.

**SupportIQ** aims at providing top of the lines Support and Management Automation for such organizations or individuals who would rather focus on their goals and still like to manage their operations, all in a fashionably easy manner. Using top of the line technologies it aims to provide the following - User Engagement through automated emails and sms, Campaign Management Techniques, Analytics on campaign. The platform is not just limited to this but becomes especially powerful and shows the real beauty by running it's custom Machine Learning algorithm to do a comparative analysis of the users campaign and generate recommendations to grow the campaign.
**SupportIQ as a SaaS focuses on reducing effort while enhancing efficiency and effectiveness**

- Support Management
- User Engagement
- Support Automation
- Campaign Optimizations
- Inbuilt Donation API to integrate with websites

# Challenges we ran into
As we are focussing mostly on non-profit org, and our product involves dealing with a lot of data points regarding those campaigns, so it was difficult to sample the dataset, but we somehow made it. using plotly for the data visualization.

## What's next for supportIQ

* Looking forward to built the product from the prototype version built at this hackathon, as we think it would be very beneficial to a lot of non-profits all across the world.
